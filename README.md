# Heart-Health-Calculator

## Project Overview
A Python-based application that assesses a user's risk of heart disease based on lifestyle and biological factors. This project demonstrates the use of structured programming, arrays, and conditional logic to solve a human healthcare problem.

## Objectives
* To create a user-friendly interface for health screening.
* To implement a scoring algorithm using Python lists and loops.
* To provide immediate feedback based on user inputs.

## Technology Stack
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Concepts Used:** Lists (Arrays), Loops (For/While), Conditional Statements (If/Elif/Else), Type Casting.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Run the script: `python main.py`
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your health details.

# Problem Statement & Scope

## 1. Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a leading cause of death. Many individuals lack an accessible, non-invasive method to perform a preliminary self-assessment of their heart health risks based on common lifestyle and historical factors before clinical intervention.

## 2. Scope of the Project
This project is a **Rule-Based Expert System** that:
* Collects user data regarding five key risk areas (age, smoking, exercise, family history, diet).
* Applies a weighted scoring algorithm to evaluate the accumulated risk score.
* Provides immediate, categorized feedback (Low, Moderate, High Risk) with basic preventative advice.

## 3. Target Users
* Adults over 30 concerned about their long-term health.
* Individuals seeking to track the impact of lifestyle changes.
* Students demonstrating foundational programming concepts (lists, conditional logic) in a practical application.

## 4. High-Level Features
* **Interactive Questionnaire:** Robust input mechanism with validation for non-empty answers.
* **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation of configuration, input, processing, and reporting modules.
* **Risk Logic Engine:** Calculates a quantitative risk score based on pre-defined health criteria.
* **Health Reporting:** Provides categorized results and advice based on the calculated score.
